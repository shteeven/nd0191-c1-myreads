# MyReads Project

This application is designed to allow users to search for and then assign books to their personal bookshelf by assigning them to one of 3 categories: currently reading, want to read, or have read a book.

## Getting Started

To start the app:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
